# Exploring Reinforcement Learning Through Chess

This project explores the development of three reinforcement learning agents in chess. These models include:
- Policy Iteration
- Table-based Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Learning
- Policy Iteration with End-Game Data

## Description

Through this project, we aimed to develop chess engines through a trail-and-error approach, unlike chess engines which are typically trained large amounts of data.
Thus, we sought to explore the applicability of these models, and determine if they provide an effective solution to the challenge of playing chess.
Considering the computational requirements to develop such models, Google Colab's free services were used. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Prior to running the code, *python-chess*, *zstd, and *tensorflow* must be installed, 

### Installing

Saved bots may be found [here] (https://github.com/zhen-zhicheng/q-learning-chess/tree/main/Saved%20Bots)

### Executing program

* The required bots corresponding to a the .ipynb must be downloaded and uploaded with the the .ipnyb
* Required bots are mentioned in the .ipnyb
